## After-party

We hosted a [social event](https://lu.ma/jfuofoxl) after the workshop for networking, awards and fun times with the community (some pictures from the EvalRS day can be found [here](https://lu.ma/jfuofoxl)).

## Overview

This is the official repository for [EvalRS @ KDD 2023](https://reclist.io/kdd2023-cup/): _a Well-Rounded Evaluation of Recommender Systems_.

Aside from papers and talks, we will host a hackathon, where participants will pursue innovative projects for the rounded evaluation of recommender systems. The aim of the hackathon is to evaluate recommender systems across a set of important dimensions (accuracy being _one_ of them) through a principled and re-usable set of abstractions, as provided by [RecList](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/reclist) ðŸš€. 

At the end of the workshop, we will sponsor a social event for teams to finalize their projects, mingle with like-minded practitioners and received the monetary prizes for best papers and projects.

This repository provides an open dataset and all the tools necessary to participate in the hackathon: everything will go back to the community as open-source contributions. Please refer to the appropriate sections below to know how to get the dataset and run the evaluation loop properly.

## Dataset and target scenario

This hackathon is based on the [LFM-1b Dataset, Corpus of Music Listening Events for Music Recommendation](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/). The use case is a typical user-item recommendation scenario: at _prediction time_, we get a set of users: for each user, our model recommends a set of songs to listen to, based on historical data on previous music consumption.

We picked LFM as it suits the spirit and the goal of this event: in particular, thanks to [rich meta-data on users](http://www.cp.jku.at/people/schedl/Research/Publications/pdf/schedl_ijmir_2017.pdf), the dataset allows us to test recommender systems among many non-obvious dimensions, on top of standard Information Retrieval Metrics (for the philosophy behind behavioral testing, please refer to the original [RecList paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09963)).

Importantly, the dataset of this workshop is a _new_, augmented version of the one used [last year at CIKM](https://github.com/RecList/evalRS-CIKM-2022): to provide richer [item meta-data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02477), we extended the LFM-1b dataset with content-based features and user-provided labels from the [WASABI dataset](https://github.com/micbuffa/WasabiDataset) (see below).

### Data overview

When you run the evaluation loop below, the code will automatically download _a chosen subset of the LFM dataset_, ready to be used (the code will download it only the first time you run it). There are three main objects available from the provided evaluation class:

_Users_: a collection of users and available meta-data, including patterns of consumption, demographics etc. In the Data Challenge scenario, the user Id is the query item for the model, which is asked to recommend songs to the user.

![http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/](images/users.png)

_Tracks_: a collection of tracks and available meta-data. In the Data Challenge scenario, tracks are the target items for the model, i.e. the collection to choose from when the model needs to provide recommendations.

![http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/](images/tracks.png)

_Historical Interactions_: a collection of interactions between users and tracks, that is, listening events, which should be used by your model to build the recommender system for the Data Challenge.

![http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b/](images/training.png)


To enrich track-related metadata, four addditional objects are provided holding features derived from the WASABI dataset:

_Social and Emotion Tags_: a collection of social tags and emotion tags collected on last.fm, together with a weight that expresses how much they have been used for a given song.

![https://github.com/micbuffa/WasabiDataset/](images/tags.png)


_Topics_: a collection of 60-dimensional sparse descriptors representing the topic distribution of a LDA topic model trained on English lyrics (model is available [here](https://github.com/micbuffa/WasabiDataset/)).


![https://github.com/micbuffa/WasabiDataset/](images/topics.png)

_Song Embeddings_: 768-dimensional SentenceBERT embeddings calculated, using the `all-mpnet-base-v2` pretrained model, on song lyrics. For each of the tracks for which lyrics were available (47% of the total number of unique songs), both embeddings calculated on the full *song* and concatenation of embeddings calculated on individual *verses* are available.

![https://sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html](images/embeddings.png)

**NOTE** that verse embeddings are quite **large** (~35GB) so they are stored as multiple parquet files, split by initial letter of band name (see an example on how to load the embeddings [here](notebooks/eda-on-the-evalrs-dataset.ipynb)). 

If you want to use them in your model, you can download them manually from the following links:

## Hack with us

### 1. Explore the dataset and code online

You can refer to our colab notebooks to start playing with the dataset and understand how to run a first, very simple model, with RecList.

| Name            | Link     | 
|-----------------|----------|
| Tutorial 1 - Exploring the EvalRS Dataset | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VXmCpL0YkLkf5_GTgJmLtd2b2A57CNjm?usp=sharing)|
| Tutorial 2 - A Dummy Model In RecList on the EvalRS Dataset  | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Cz9k8dIqzZ8Eetpv4aiihmpjp3TivIz7?usp=sharing)|
| Tutorial 3 - A Song Embedding Model on the EvalRS Dataset | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rE0nuXiDRqSEtSiubkDp-F2vKssRsJgT?usp=sharing)|
| Tutorial 4 - A tutorial on building Retrieval Models (MF, Two-Tower) using Merlin| [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ftl2B7BVFMfFjyjWweFCP_gA_LdCl7-a?usp=sharing)|
| Appendix - How to Write a RecList | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GVsVB1a3H9qbRQvwtb0TBDxq8A5nXc5w?usp=sharing)|

### 2. Get your local setup working

Download the repo and setup a virtual environment. _NOTE_: the code has been developed and tested with Python 3.9: please use the same version for reproducibility.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RecList/evalRS-KDD-2023
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the provided sample script for testing the evaluation loop with _random predictions_ (tote that that you can use the `example_model` notebook if you prefer a notebook interface):

```bash
cd evaluation
python eval.py
```

Now that the loop is setup correctly, time to test a real model!

#### Bonus: using a third-party experimental tracking tool

If you wish to use [Comet](https://www.comet.com/) or [Neptune](https://app.neptune.ai/) to automatically track the results of running recList, you can do so by passing an additional parameter (`comet` or `neptune`) to our sample script:

```bash 
python eval.py comet
python eval.py neptune
```

At loading time, the script will load env variables in a local `.env` files and use them automatically to configure remote logging. You can create your own `.env` files starting from the provided `local.env` template, and filling it with your secrets.

Please make sure the relevant Python packages from your tracking provider are installed in the environment.

### 3. Run evaluation on a real-world model

We also provide the saved predictions files from the baseline models trained on the EvalRS dataset with [Merlin tutorial](notebooks/merlin_tf_tutorial/).  
You can use those prediction files to run the evaluation directly with RecList using this [notebook](notebooks/merlin_tf_tutorial/evalrs_kdd_2023_reclist_eval_on_saved_preds.ipynb).


## Hackathon Structure and Rules

### How the Hackathon runs

We will ask participants to come up with a contribution for the rounded evaluation of recommender systems, based on the dataset and tools available in this repository. Contribution details will be intentionally left open-ended, as we would like participants to engage different angles of the problem on a shared set of resources. 

Examples could be operationalizing important notions of robustness, applying and discussing metric definitions from literature, quantifying the trade-off between privacy and accuracy, and so on. The hackathon is a unique opportunity to **live and breathe** the workshop themes, increase chances of multi-disciplinary collaboration, network and discover related work by peers, and contribute valuable materials back to the community. 

### Rules

* The hackathon will start during the workshop and continue at the social gathering.
* You do *not* need a paper in the workshop to participate: if you are in person, you need to register to the KDD workshop, if you're remote (see below) reach out to us directly.
* Remote teams that are not able to join KDD in person can participate to the hackathon if willing to operate during the workshop hours: please send a message to `claudio dot pomo at poliba dot it` and `fede at stanford dot edu` if you're interested in participating remotely.
* Teams can start working on their project before KDD, provided they will also work during the event and engage the other participants during the workshop.
* The only dataset that can be used is the one provided with this repository (you can, of course, _augment_ it if you see fit): given the open-ended nature of the challenge, we are happy for participants to choose whatever tool they desire: for example, you can bring your own model or use the ones we provide if the point you are making is independent from any modelling choice. Please note that if you focus on offline code-based evaluation, re-using and extending the provided RecList provides bonus points, as our goal is to progressively standardize testing through a common library.
* The deliverables for each team are two: 1) a public GitHub repository with an open source license containing whatever has been used for the project (e.g. code, materials, slides, charts); 2) a elevator pitch (video duration needs to be less than 3 minutes) to explain (using any narrative device: e.g. a demo, a demo and some slides, animations) the project: motivation, execution, learnings and why it is cool.
* Based on the materials submitted and the elevator pitch, the organizers will determine the winners at their sole discretion and award the prizes at the social event the evening of Aug. 7th.

### Inspiration

We invite participants to come up with interesting and original projects related to the well-rounded evaluation of recommender systems. As suggestions and inspirations, we list few themes / possibilities to get teams started:

* Did you publish a paper on RecSys evaluation or did you like [one accepted to EvalRS](https://github.com/RecList/evalRS-KDD-2023/tree/main/papers)? Can you extend the official [RecList](https://github.com/RecList/evalRS-KDD-2023/blob/main/evaluation/EvalRSReclist.py) to include the new methods and draw new insights about our dataset?
* Did you recently train a new RecSys model and want to compare the new architecture vs an industry standard Merlin model using RecList?
* Are you interested in data visualization / dataset exploration? Can you find where in the user (item) space the Merlin model we provide tend to underperform?
* How much latent space metrics, such as ["being less wrong"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09963), change when the underlying space is built through song2vec vs for example content-embeddings through lyrics?

### Prizes

Thanks to our generous sponsors, the following prizes are awarded (at the sole discretion of the committee):

* a winner prize, 2000 USD, for the best hackathon project;
* a runner-up prize, 500 USD, for the second best hackathon project;
* a best paper award prize of 500 USD;
* a best student paper award prize of 500 USD.

### Winners

* the GrubHub team won the prize for the best hackathon project;
* the Hinge + Rubber Ducky Labs team won the prize for second best hackathon project;
* the best paper award was won by the paper by Noble et al.;
* the best student paper award was won by the paper by Petr KasalickÃ½ et al.
